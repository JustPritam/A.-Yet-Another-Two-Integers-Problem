We can add or subtract 10 until the difference between a and b becomes less than 10. 
And if it is not 0 after all such moves, we need one additional move.

Let d=|a−b| is the absolute difference between a and b. The final answer is ⌊d10⌋ plus one if dmod10>0. 
This formula can be represented as d divided by 10 rounded up, in other words ⌊d+910⌋.
